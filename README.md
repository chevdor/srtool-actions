## Introduction

[srtool](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool) is a docker image that allows building Substrate WASM Runtimes in a deterministic manner. It ensures that all `srtool` users (and tooling), using the same/latest tag, will produce 100% exactly the same runtime. It enables further trustless verifications.

This repository contains a custom [Github Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) that will help you integrate `srtool` in your Github CI.

Gitlab users are not left behind and can use the 2 first options mentioned below.

## Srtool helpers

There are now several ways to use `srtool` in your project:

-   using `srtool` [via alias](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool#user-content-using-an-alias): powerful but very verbose and prone to errors. This is for developers. This option is being deprecated and not recommended.

-   using the [srtool-cli](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli): much easier to use and removes a whole bunch of potential userâ€™s mistakes. This is for developers.

-   using the [srtool-app](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-app): the easiest option of all thanks to its GUI. This is good for non-developers.

-   using the Github actions from [this repo](https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-actions). This is for your automatic CI.

## Requirements

In order to use this Github Action, you will need a Github repository with your Substrate based project. You can learn how to get started with a first Github workflow [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).

Before you setup your new workflow, you should gather the following information:

-   name of your chain: ie. polkadot

-   runtime package: ie. runtime-polkadot

-   location of your runtime: ie. runtime/polkadot

If your project uses standard values (such as your runtime package being named `xyz-runtime` if your chain is `xyz`), you will be able to skip many of the inputs. If you have a different setup, you can override the defaults to make it work for you.

## Sample workflows

Make sure you store the yml files shown below in your repository under `.github/workflows`.

## Dev notes

Due to a [bug in act](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/655), the defaults defined in the action are not applied. That means **must** pass all the inputs while testing with `act`.

You can test locally using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

    act -W tests

To make it easier, you can also use `just`:

    just test <test_name>

For instance:

    # Run the default dev workflow: tests/dev.yml
    just test

    # Run the ipfs test workflow
    just test ipfs
