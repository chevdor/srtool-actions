== Parachain overrides

Similar to https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm[subwasm], the parachain pallet ID and the `authorize_upgrade` call ID can be overriden by `PARACHAIN_PALLET_ID` and `AUTHORIZE_UPGRADE_PREFIX` environmental variables, respectively. It will affect the generated proposal hash `parachain_authorize_upgrade_hash`.

If unset, the two envs will have the following default values:

- `PARACHAIN_PALLET_ID`:      `0x01`
- `AUTHORIZE_UPGRADE_PREFIX`: `0x02`
