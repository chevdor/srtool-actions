== Dev notes

WARNING: Due to a https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/655[bug in act], the defaults defined in the action are not applied. That means **must** pass all the inputs while testing with `act`.

You can test locally using https://github.com/nektos/act[act]:

    act -W tests

To make it easier, you can also use `just`:

    just test <test_name>

For instance:

----
# Run the default dev workflow: tests/dev.yml
just test

# Run the ipfs test workflow
just test ipfs
----
