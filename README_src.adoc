== Introduction

https://github.com/chevdor/srtool[srtool] is a docker image that allows building Substrate WASM Runtimes in a deterministic manner. It ensures that all `srtool` users (and tooling), using the same/latest tag, will produce 100% exactly the same runtime. It enables further trustless verifications.

This repository contains a custom https://docs.github.com/en/actions[Github Action] that will help you integrate `srtool` in your Github CI.

NOTE: Gitlab users are not left behind and can use the 2 first options mentioned below.

== Srtool helpers

There are now several ways to use `srtool` in your project:

- using `srtool` https://github.com/chevdor/srtool#user-content-using-an-alias[via alias]: powerful but very verbose and prone to errors. This is for developers. This option is being deprecated and not recommended.
- using the https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli[srtool-cli]: much easier to use and removes a whole bunch of potential user's mistakes. This is for developers.
- using the https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-app[srtool-app]: the easiest option of all thanks to its GUI. This is good for non-developers.
- using the Github actions from https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-actions[this repo]. This is for your automatic CI.

== Requirements

In order to use this Github Action, you will need a Github repository with your Substrate based project. You can learn how to get started with a first Github workflow https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart[here].

Before you setup your new workflow, you should gather the following information:

- name of your chain: ie. polkadot
- runtime package: ie. runtime-polkadot
- location of your runtime: ie. runtime/polkadot

If your project uses standard values (such as your runtime package being named `xyz-runtime` if your chain is `xyz`), you will be able to skip many of the inputs. If you have a different setup, you can override the defaults to make it work for you.
